# resume
my personal resume. you can see it online on [github pages](https://morilon.github.io/morilon/) and on [azure](https://muriloalmeida.azurewebsites.net/)

## environment setup
install the following before all else.

```npm
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

```npm
npm install -g typescript
```

```npm
npm install -g tslint
```

## settings setup
I have a gist with a default vs code settings; https://gist.github.com/morilon/91a72d0acd821bb00ae9974278f693f5 and you can use the [Settings-Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) extension to syncronize it.

## Running the app
straightforward basics;

```npm
npm install
```

```ng
ng serve -o
```
